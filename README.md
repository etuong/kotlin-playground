## Kotlin

This repository is a playground to learn Kotlin. If you are experienced with Java, you'll find Kotlin very enjoyable and fun to work with. It's incredibly terse and addresses many Java's flaw. I like to think that if Python and Java had a child, it'd be Kotlin!

### Notes

This repo uses a Gradle 7.5 wrapper that is compatiable with Java 18. You may use any version of Java but you'll want to  change distributionUrl in the gradle-wrapper.properties.
